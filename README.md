# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Regression-and-Classification
[Coursera] [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

In the first course of the Machine Learning Specialization.
Course description:

- Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn.

- Build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear regression and logistic regression

The Machine Learning Specialization is a foundational online program created in collaboration between DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online. 

In this beginner-friendly program, you will learn the fundamentals of machine learning and how to use these techniques to build real-world AI applications. 

This version is aimed at adapting the python courses to colab and extending both code and course description and commenting for clarity.

Tasks in progress :

- Full colab adaptation
- Improve comments and descriptions
- Optimize code if necessary
